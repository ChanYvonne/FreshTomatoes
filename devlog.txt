       Copied old authen code and modified it to work with new system.
       Login/register both don't work currently, but I am hoping to get more of it done by tomorrow.
       Also copied over bootstrap and jquery.min.js, which I will be using to make the front end design.

       revised the login/register system.
       separated Login and Register, creating register.html, which extends login.html

       Resolved issues with register / login that Yvonne presented to me
       Added a basic bootstrap navbar to home.html

       Added some styling to home.html
       Having an empty search query is currently an issue, although it should be a quick fix.
       Added automatic redirection from register to login if the registration is sucessful.

       Styled up search_results.html
       Some images are missing, so we might have to figure out a workaround. Or we can leave it as is.
       Some images are also bigger than the rest, which is bothering me to no end. I can't even style it to change it, because bootstrap's css takes priority for some reason
