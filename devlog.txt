       Copied old authen code and modified it to work with new system.
       Login/register both don't work currently, but I am hoping to get more of it done by tomorrow.
       Also copied over bootstrap and jquery.min.js, which I will be using to make the front end design.

       Having an empty search query is currently an issue, although it should be a quick fix.
