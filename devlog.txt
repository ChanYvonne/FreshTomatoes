All -- 2016-12-5 12:30
       added initial files
       revised design document with new and more efficient ideas
kevinZ -- 2016-12-5 12:32
       Copied old authen code and modified it to work with new system.
       Login/register both don't work currently, but I am hoping to get more of it done by tomorrow.
       Also copied over bootstrap and jquery.min.js, which I will be using to make the front end design.

       revised the login/register system.
       separated Login and Register, creating register.html, which extends login.html
kevinZ -- 2016-12-6 3:23
       Added some styling to login and register pages.
kevinZ -- 2016-12-6 6:34
       Revised DESIGN.pdf, changing the flow chart to new specifications. Added some other things as well
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 12:13
       Resolved issues with register / login that Yvonne presented to me
       Added a basic bootstrap navbar to home.html
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 5:20
      Wrote basic interactAPI.py functions to request TMDB API for movie data
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 5:45
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py, home.html to implement basic search functionality (can search for keywords in a movie title; results appear tabulated)
      Created search_results.html to display results
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 6:29
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py home.html, search_results.html to display results from a movie search
      Created movie.html to display page for single movie
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 8:36
       Added some styling to home.html
       Having an empty search query is currently an issue, although it should be a quick fix.
       Added automatic redirection from register to login if the registration is sucessful.
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 8:56
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py, movie.html, search_results.html to display movie posters along with other relevant info previously included (e.g. title, year)
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 10:19
       Styled up search_results.html
       Some images are missing, so we might have to figure out a workaround. Or we can leave it as is.
       Some images are also bigger than the rest, which is bothering me to no end. I can't even style it to change it, because bootstrap's css takes priority for some reason
kevinZ -- 2016-12-8 12:52
       Added option to switch between searching for actors or movies.
       Currently the display is a bit buggy ( css not working out ) but I will make modifications later in the day
       Also modified search_results.html to split into 6 columns, instead of 3
