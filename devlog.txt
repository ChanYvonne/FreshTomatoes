Devlog for Fresh Tomatoes:

All -- 2016-12-5 12:30
       added initial files
       revised design document with new and more efficient ideas
kevinZ -- 2016-12-5 12:32
       Copied old authen code and modified it to work with new system.
       Login/register both don't work currently, but I am hoping to get more of it done by tomorrow.
       Also copied over bootstrap and jquery.min.js, which I will be using to make the front end design.
kevinZ -- 2016-12-6 1:13
       revised the login/register system.
       separated Login and Register, creating register.html, which extends login.html
kevinZ -- 2016-12-6 3:23
       Added some styling to login and register pages.
kevinZ -- 2016-12-6 6:34
       Revised DESIGN.pdf, changing the flow chart to new specifications. Added some other things as well
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 12:13
       Resolved issues with register / login that Yvonne presented to me
       Added a basic bootstrap navbar to home.html
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 5:20
      Wrote basic interactAPI.py functions to request TMDB API for movie data
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 5:45
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py, home.html to implement basic search functionality (can search for keywords in a movie title; results appear tabulated)
      Created search_results.html to display results
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 6:29
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py home.html, search_results.html to display results from a movie search
      Created movie.html to display page for single movie
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 8:36
       Added some styling to home.html
       Having an empty search query is currently an issue, although it should be a quick fix.
       Added automatic redirection from register to login if the registration is sucessful.
nalaS -- 2016-12-7 8:56
      Updated app.py, interactAPI.py, movie.html, search_results.html to display movie posters along with other relevant info previously included (e.g. title, year)
kevinZ -- 2016-12-7 10:19
       Styled up search_results.html
       Some images are missing, so we might have to figure out a workaround. Or we can leave it as is.
       Some images are also bigger than the rest, which is bothering me to no end. I can't even style it to change it, because bootstrap's css takes priority for some reason
kevinZ -- 2016-12-8 12:52
       Added option to switch between searching for actors or movies.
       Currently the display is a bit buggy ( css not working out ) but I will make modifications later in the day
       Also modified search_results.html to split into 6 columns, instead of 3
kevinZ -- 2016-12-8 5:23
       Added some styling to movie.html
       Fixed the css for the search bar. Nala can now do her magic ( I added a section in the code for her )
nalaS -- 2016-12-8 8:06
      Worked on actor search for a couple of hours, and it literally should be working, but it isn't...
nalaS -- 2016-12-9 12:38
      Privated API keys, tried to work on actor search (somewhat unsuccessfully)
jonathanB -- 2016-12-10 1:11
	  Got the NYT api to work, added a link to the review on movie page
jonathanB -- 2016-12-10 6:27
	  Finished the list backend and reconfigured the database structure, polished up code here and there
kevinZ -- 2016-12-12 10:46
       Added some styling to account.html.
       Added background-color to .container-fluid class, so the color should fill up the page now. Can't confirm b/c my computer has it filled in anyways.
jonathanB -- 2016-12-13 9:58
	  Linked up button to actually add movies to database
	  Squashed some bugs
nalaS -- 2016-12-14 12:20
      Worked on debugging random movie generator
nalaS -- 2016-12-14 7:38
      Worked some more on debugging random movie generator. Identified two errors with python API interpretation, resolved one, listed the other in README as a bug.
yvonneC -- 2016-12-14 7:50
	Fixed up list.html and added savedMovie List to Navbar
	Got random movie working -- but doesn't work due to timeouts sometimes (same error that caused actor search to not work)
	Encounted major bug with nyt api but fixed it (movies with numbers in the name were not working before but now it does!)
kevinZ -- 2016-12-14 8:37
       Added the Logo to the search page
       Changed some of the background coloring to match with the logo colors
nalaS -- 2016-12-14 9:23
      Worked on debugging actor search
