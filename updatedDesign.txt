The following changes were made to our website that differs from the design doc:
    -Several files were renamed, such as results.html ( into search_results.html ), self.py ( into account.py ), and others
    -editAccount.html was removed, because we were unable to get the functionalities it needed.
    -search.py and movie.py was merged and put into interactAPI.py, which handles all the information from the APIs.
    -New file storage.py, which adds/changes info to the database for the saved movies list
    -added picture logo
    -movie pages now include only a summary, release year, quote(if applicable), and link to a review on NYT
